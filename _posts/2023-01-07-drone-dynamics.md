# Introduction

At the beginning of my junior year in DGIST (Daegu Kyeonbuk Institute of Science and Technology), I set my UGRP (Undergraduate Group Research Program) project's theme as drone. At that very moment, I did not know much about drone, although I like aircraft. However, I was aware of the future potential of it. Therefore, I began to study about drone.

As a candidate to be an Engineer, it was natural for me to study its dynamics, from which many things can be derived: control, hardware, software, electrics, sensors, etc..

# Coordinate Definition

Before figuring out dynamics of drone, it's imperative to know about the coordinate system; drone (body frame) and the global world (reference frame) are not the same.
